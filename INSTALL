This directory contains an easy-to-use Makefile for compiling and installing KDL with our patches.

Prerequisites
=============

You need the most recent version of SIP (packages sip4 python-sip4 python-sip4-dev).
Install them with

# sudo make sysdep

Downloading, Patching and Compiling
===================================

Just type

# make

If you want a different installation destination, type:

# PREFIX=/path/to/your/destination make

Example for your local DIR directory:

PREFIX=${HOME}/local/DIR/kdl make

Installing
==========

For the kdl library:

make install

For the python bindings:

make install-python

(This will assume you are using xstow in the directory ${PREFIX}/../)
